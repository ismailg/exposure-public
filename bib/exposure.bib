  abstract = {Virtual labs allow researchers to design high-throughput and macro-level experiments that are not feasible in traditional in-person physical lab settings. Despite the increasing popularity of online research, researchers still face many technical and logistical barriers when designing and deploying virtual lab experiments. While several platforms exist to facilitate the development of virtual lab experiments, they typically present researchers with a stark trade-off between usability and functionality. We introduce Empirica: a modular virtual lab that offers a solution to the usability--functionality trade-off by employing a ``flexible defaults'' design strategy. This strategy enables us to maintain complete ``build anything'' flexibility while offering a development platform that is accessible to novice programmers. Empirica's architecture is designed to allow for parameterizable experimental designs, reusable protocols, and rapid development. These features will increase the accessibility of virtual lab experiments, remove barriers to innovation in experiment design, and enable rapid progress in the understanding of human behavior.},

It deals with the affectional bonds between individuals, their origins in childhood and adolescent relationships, the distress caused by involuntary severance of such bonds or by their faulty development, and the treatment of these disturbances. Many family situations are described in which the formation of personal bonds can be prevented or distorted by parental behavior, not only in childhood but in later life. Four principles of therapeutic intervention on the basis of AT are set forth. (1) The therapist must provide the patient with a secure base from which to explore past and current experience. (2) The therapist must join the patient in exploring the situations in which the patient finds him or herself. (3) The patient must be helped to understand the therapist's feelings and actions toward the patient. (4) The patient must be helped to understand his or her current situations and to interpret them in terms of childhood experiences with attachment figures.

A third-party's material payoff is not affected by the decisions made by the other participants, but this person may choose to punish a responder who has been overly selfish. The concern over this possibility may serve to discipline potentially selfish responders. We also explore a treatment in which the third party may also choose to reward a sender who has received a low net payoff as a result of the responder's action. We find a strong and significant effect of third-party punishment in both punishment regimes, as the amount sent by the first mover is more than 60\% higher when there is the possibility of third-party punishment. We also find that responders return a higher proportion of the amount sent to them when there is the possibility of punishment, with this proportion slightly higher when reward is not feasible. Finally, third parties punish less when reward is feasible, but nevertheless spend more on the combination of reward and punishment when these are both permitted than on punishment when this is the only choice for redressing material outcomes.},

Numerous studies have documented the behavioral sequelae of maltreatment, which include impaired functioning across the social and personal domains. Nonetheless, the field has made little headway in identifying the specific psychological mediators of these behavioral effects. Over the past few years, the authors have been developing and testing a theory that addresses this question. They contend that the core psychological message that various forms of maltreatment convey to children is that of rejection. This message leads children to develop a heightened sensitivity to rejection. They have termed this disposition "rejection sensitivity," and have begun to document how it undermines relationships and impairs functioning in both college students and early adolescents. To date, their studies have focused primarily on documenting the role of rejection sensitivity in fostering a hostile and aggressive interpersonal style, which can promote violence in peer and romantic relationships.  This chapter describes their theoretical model and the program of research is being undertaken to test and refine the model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Study 4 demonstrates that rejection-sensitive people and their romantic partners are dissatisfied with their relationships.

This study investigated the relationship between emotion dysregulation, impulsiveness, and impaired mentalizing in the context of predicting interpersonal problems in BPD. A total of 210 patients with BPD completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (RFQ), and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). The authors conducted three path models, with either mentalizing, emotion regulation, or impulsiveness as the exogenous variable. Emotion dysregulation and attentional impulsiveness predicted interpersonal problems directly, whereas hypomentalizing predicted interpersonal problems only indirectly throughout emotion dysregulation and attentional impulsiveness. The results suggest that these domains contribute significantly to interpersonal problems in BPD. Moreover, hypomentalizing might affect on interpersonal problems via its effect on impulsiveness and emotion regulation. The authors argue that focusing on emotion regulation and mentalizing in BPD treatments might have interlinked beneficial effects on interpersonal problems.},

We design trust games with partner selection, in which the proposer chooses between a familiar responder and a stranger with a higher multiplier. When choosing between the two responders, the proposer faces tradeoffs between economic opportunities and social distance. Comparing participants' behaviors to those in a standalone trust game, we find that in the virtual world experiment the proposers are more likely to select the socially closer responders despite the lower rate of investment returns, and the latter reciprocate by returning a higher proportion than the socially distant responders. Virtual communication also plays an important role on the proposers' choice and the responders' reciprocity. In contrast, social distance and virtual communication have less impact in the lab with a student sample.},

Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human social networks.},

Response magnitude correlated with the ``intention to trust'' on the next play of the game, and the peak of these ``intention to trust'' responses shifted its time of occurrence by 14 seconds as player reputations developed. This temporal transfer resembles a similar shift of reward prediction errors common to reinforcement learning models, but in the context of a social exchange. These data extend previous model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies into the social domain and broaden our view of the spectrum of functions implemented by the dorsal striatum.},

Neurally, activity in the anterior insula, a region known to respond to norm violations across affective, interoceptive, economic, and social dimensions, strongly differentiated healthy participants from individuals with BPD. Healthy subjects showed a strong linear relation between anterior insula response and both magnitude of monetary offer received from their partner (input) and the amount of money repaid to their partner (output). In stark contrast, activity in the anterior insula of BPD participants was related only to the magnitude of repayment sent back to their partner (output), not to the magnitude of offers received (input). These neural and behavioral data suggest that norms used in perception of social gestures are pathologically perturbed or missing altogether among individuals with BPD. This game-theoretic approach to psychopathology may open doors to new ways of characterizing and studying a range of mental illnesses.},

  abstract = {Two experiments tested whether negative reinforcement-contrast would occur in newborn humans. One group received two 5-min periods of water alternated with 5-min periods of 15\% sucrose. Rate of sucking during water periods was lower than in a second group given only water through-out the 20-min session. Such reduced responding to water, after sucrose experience, provides evidence for a negative contrast effect. A group receiving alternated sucrose and no-fluid also showed reduced sucking rate during the no-fluid periods in comparison with a no-fluid control group. The observed negative contrast effect must be a reinforcement and not a peripheral sensory phenomenon, since any persistent effect sucrose might have on the taste receptors would tend to enhance rather than depress responding during no-fluid conditions.},

This review examines four broad areas of research within social cognitive neuroscience: (a) understanding others, (b) understanding oneself, (c) controlling oneself, and (d) the processes that occur at the interface of self and others. In addition, this review highlights two core-processing distinctions that can be neurocognitively identified across all of these domains. The distinction between automatic versus controlled processes has long been important to social psychological theory and can be dissociated in the neural regions contributing to social cognition. Alternatively, the differentiation between internally-focused processes that focus on one's own or another's mental interior and externally-focused processes that focus on one's own or another's visible features and actions is a new distinction. This latter distinction emerges from social cognitive neuroscience investigations rather than from existing psychological theories demonstrating that social cognitive neuroscience can both draw on and contribute to social psychological theory.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models have increasingly replaced mixed-model analyses of variance for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers \& Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal {$\alpha$} in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.},

Findings showed that secure persons felt more trust toward partners, showed higher accessibility of positive trust-related memories, reported more positive trust episodes over a 3-week period, and adopted more constructive strategies in coping with the violation of trust than insecure persons. In addition, whereas intimacy attainment was the main trust-related goal for all the attachment groups, security attainment was an additional goal of anxious-ambivalent persons, and control attainment was an additional goal of avoidant persons. Findings are discussed in terms of attachment working models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background.               Current systems of describing personality pathology have significant shortcomings. A  polydiagnostic approach is used to study the relationship between psychological, psychoanalytical  and psychopathological models of personality.                                         Methods.               The subjects were 256 patients enrolled in treatment studies of major depression and  bulimia nervosa. Subjects were assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the  Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DMS-III-R  personality disorders (SCID-II).                                         Results.               Subjects had high rates of DSM-III-R personality disorders with 52\% having at least one  personality disorder. Cluster A personality disorders were correlated with low reward dependence,  high harm avoidance and low self-directedness and cooperativeness. Cluster B personality disorders  were related to high novelty seeking and low self-directedness and cooperativeness. Cluster C  personality disorders were correlated with high harm avoidance and low novelty seeking and low  self-directedness. Immature defences were related to DSM-III-R personality symptoms, but  individual defences were not related to personality clusters in a predictable way. Immature defences  were strongly related to low self-directedness and cooperativeness. Both TCI self-directedness scores  and immature defence scores were moderately predictive of the presence and number of personality  disorders.                                         Conclusion.               A widely accepted clinical nosology (DSM-III-R personality disorders) rated using a  clinical interview correlates reasonably predictably with two theoretical models derived from  different paradigms and rated using self-reports. This might be seen as providing concurrent validity  for all three models. However, serious methodological shortcomings confront studies of this type,  including sample selection and measurement of personality dysfunction. One way to begin to  resolve these problems is to study which personality measures are best related to treatment response  and prognosis.},

Method: To do so, we examine whether BPD traits are connected to an untrustworthiness bias toward neutral male and female faces in a non clinical sample of young female college students (N = 110). Unlike previous research, we examine the potential role of the different components of RS (emotional and cognitive) separately, and we consider the anger dimension as potentially relevant for trust ratings. Results: Our results demonstrated that only the emotional components (anxiety and anger) and not the cognitive (expectation) mediated the association between BPD traits and trust ratings. Conclusions: We discussed the importance of considering all three components of RS for a better understanding of the relation between BPD and trust appraisal.

Evidence for mentalizing deficits in other mental disorders, such as depression, is less robust and these links have never been explored while accounting for the effects of BPD on mentalizing. Additionally, it is unknown whether BPD symptoms might moderate any relationship between depressive symptoms and mentalizing.                                         Methods               Using multivariate regression modelling on cross-sectional data obtained from a sample of 274 participants recruited from clinical settings, we investigated the association between mentalizing impairment and depression and examined whether this was moderated by the presence and number of concurrent BPD symptoms, while adjusting for socio-demographic confounders.                                         Results                                Impaired mentalizing was associated with depressive symptoms, after adjustment for socio-demographic confounders and BPD symptoms (                 p                 \,=\,0.002, {$\beta$}\,=\,-\,0.18). BPD symptoms significantly moderated the association between impaired mentalizing and depressive symptoms (                 p                 \,=\,0.003), with more severe borderline symptoms associated with a stronger effect of poor mentalization on increased depressive symptoms.                                                        Conclusion               Mentalizing impairments occur in depression even after adjusting for the effect of BPD symptoms. Our findings help further characterise mentalizing impairments in depression, as well as the moderating effect of BPD symptoms on this association..

  abstract = {Contrast refers to a comparison between two conditions of reward such that the relation between them is magnified (relative to an appropriate control condition). It is an effect that is opposite in direction from generalization (which is a form of averaging). Three kinds of contrast have received substantial empirical attention: Incentive contrast in which a sudden change in reward (either an increase or a decrease) results in an overreaction to the change, relative to a control condition; anticipatory contrast in which an anticipated improvement in reward results in less consumption of an initial reward; and differential or behavioral contrast in which a change in reward associated with one stimulus results in a change in behavior associated with a second stimulus in the opposite direction. Here I discuss a fourth kind of contrast that I call within-trial contrast. In this form of contrast a discriminative stimulus is preferred when it follows a less appetitive event (effort, delay, or the absence of reward). A model of this kind of contrast is proposed that is based on a presumed change in the hedonic state of the organism between the end of the less appetitive event and the reward (or stimulus signaling the reward). It is distinguished from an account based on the relative reduction in delay to reinforcement. Finally, I suggest that a general form of this within-trial contrast may help to explain various complex human social phenomena including cognitive dissonance, justification of effort, the effect of extrinsic rewards on behavior that is maintained by intrinsic rewards, and learned industriousness.},
